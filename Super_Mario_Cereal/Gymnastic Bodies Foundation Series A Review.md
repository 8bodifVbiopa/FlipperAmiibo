# Gymnastic Bodies Foundation Series: A Review
 
If you are looking for a comprehensive and progressive bodyweight training program that can help you develop strength, mobility, and skills, you might have heard of the Gymnastic Bodies Foundation Series. This is a set of online courses created by Coach Christopher Sommer, a former US national team gymnastics coach and the founder of GymnasticBodies. The Foundation Series consists of four main tracks: Upper Body, Core, Lower Body, and Handstand. Each track has several levels of difficulty and hundreds of exercises that are designed to prepare you for advanced gymnastic movements.

In this article, I will review the Foundation Series and share my personal experience with it. I will also discuss some of the pros and cons of the program, as well as some tips and recommendations for anyone who wants to try it out.
 
## What is the Foundation Series?
 
The Foundation Series is a collection of online courses that teach you how to train like a gymnast using only your bodyweight and minimal equipment. The courses are hosted on GymFit TV by GymnasticBodies[^1^], a platform that also offers other programs such as Stretch Series, Thrive Nutrition, and GB Plus. The Foundation Series is divided into four main tracks: Upper Body, Core, Lower Body, and Handstand. Each track has seven levels of difficulty, from Level 1 to Level 7. Each level has four exercises that target different aspects of strength and mobility. For example, the Upper Body track has Push Strength, Pull Strength, Shoulder Articulation, and Bodyline exercises.
 
The goal of the Foundation Series is to help you master the basic gymnastic skills that are prerequisites for more advanced movements. For instance, the Push Strength exercises lead to a Hollow Back Press, the Pull Strength exercises lead to a Full Rope Climb, the Shoulder Articulation exercises lead to a Straddle Planche, and the Bodyline exercises lead to a Front Lever. The Core track has three sub-tracks: Sideline, Compression, and Leg Strength & Mobility. The Sideline exercises lead to a Side Lever (or Human Flag), the Compression exercises lead to a Manna, and the Leg Strength & Mobility exercises lead to a Single Leg Squat.
 
The Handstand track is a separate course that teaches you how to balance on your hands in various positions and orientations. It has five levels of difficulty, from Level 1 to Level 5. Each level has four exercises that focus on different aspects of handstand training such as alignment, endurance, mobility, strength, and control.
 
## How does the Foundation Series work?
 
The Foundation Series is based on a progressive overload principle that gradually increases the difficulty and intensity of the exercises as you improve your strength and mobility. Each exercise has several progressions that are designed to challenge you at your current level of ability. For example, the first progression of the Push Strength exercise is an Incline Push-Up[^1^], while the final progression is a Hollow Back Press[^1^]. You start with the easiest progression that you can perform with good form and work your way up to the harder ones.
 
The program also follows a periodization model that varies the volume and intensity of your workouts over time. Each level has four phases: Preparation Phase (PP), Strength Phase (SP), Mobility Phase (MP), and Deload Phase (DP). The PP lasts for two weeks and introduces you to the new exercises at a low volume and intensity. The SP lasts for six weeks and increases the volume and intensity of your workouts to build strength. The MP lasts for two weeks and focuses on improving your mobility and flexibility with static and dynamic stretches. The DP lasts for one week and reduces the volume and intensity of your workouts to allow your body to recover and adapt.
 
The program also provides you with detailed instructions on how to perform each exercise correctly, how to warm up properly, how to measure your progress, how to avoid injuries, how to modify or scale the exercises if needed, how to schedule your workouts, how to eat well, how to rest well, and how to troubleshoot common problems.
 
## What are the pros and cons of the Foundation Series?
